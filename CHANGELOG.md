# Changelog

A hub keeps working when the website is newer than its backend: new pages appear once the hub's `Code.gs` lists the feature. To update a Google Sheet hub, paste the new `Code.gs` and deploy a **new version** of the same deployment ([setup.md → Updating](setup.md#updating)); on your own server run `hubctl deploy`.

## 5.1.1 — 2026-10-06

- **Errors say what is actually wrong.** When Google answers with its own web page instead of the hub's data, the website now reads that page and names the cause: permissions need renewing, the code wasn't saved before deploying, the link points to a hub ID that doesn't exist, Google's time limit or quotas, or a sign-in page (access not set to *Anyone*). Anything else quotes Google's words and points to *Apps Script → Executions*. Before, every case said *"check that the web app is deployed with access Anyone"*, which was usually not the problem. The full page is logged in the browser console.
- **Settings → About this hub → Test the hub** (was *Run a health check*): tests reading and saving separately (they travel differently, so one can fail while the other works), shows the hub ID this page uses, and warns when people's links and invites use a different one.
- Backend: `doGet` / `doPost` always answer with JSON, even if writing the answer fails, so Google never replaces it with an error page.
- Long error messages stay on screen long enough to read.
- setup.md → Troubleshooting lists each message and its fix.

## 5.1.0 — 2026-10-04

- **Ambassadors.** Students who bring their school, each with a code and a link `<hub>/r/CODE` (a QR code on their poster). New page *Ambassadors* for everyone on the team: whoever adds an ambassador is their **buddy** and looks after them; leads see and change them all. *Add several*, *Send their page* (a ready Telegram message in the hub's languages), *Poster*, pause / left, channel codes (`IG`, `UZ1`… for a place rather than a person), *Sunday leaderboard* (top 5, first names only, to copy into the ambassadors' group). Applications has a new interest *School ambassador* and a *Make ambassador* button. The Overview shows an Ambassadors card.
- **Referral links.** `/r/CODE` always ends on your signup page with `?ref=CODE`, so HQ counts the referral. With `referrals = on` (Settings → Referrals & ambassadors) the page first asks the friend's first name (Uzbek / Russian / English) and saves it with the code — nothing else — so you know who invited whom and hand out rewards at check-in. Off (the default) saves nothing; printed QR codes work either way. On your own server `/r/CODE` goes straight to the signup page while names are off.
- **An ambassador's own page** (`#/amb?k=…&s=…`, no account): their link, QR code, an A4 poster to print, the message to forward, their numbers, the rewards they reached and the top 5. It never shows anyone's contacts. A new link switches the old one off.
- **Check-in.** During the event days everyone on the team can tick *Came* in *Ambassadors → Names*, or add someone who says who invited them. From the first event day the leaderboard counts friends who came, capped at `referral_cap` (8).
- **Privacy.** After `referral_delete_after` (default: 7 days after the event) the hub deletes friends' names and ambassadors' contacts, notes and page links by itself; the numbers stay. Admins can do it any time. The bot never messages ambassadors; buddies get one Sunday message about their own ambassadors, and the weekly report has an ambassadors section.
- Grew out of Abbos's **Referral page, part 1** (5.0.0): his code whitelist and formula guard are now in `Code.gs`, and the separate `apps-script/referrals/` web app is gone — one place for the data, no second Sheet.
- QR codes are made in the browser by the vendored [qrcode-generator](https://github.com/kazuhikoarase/qrcode-generator) (MIT, `docs/js/vendor/qrcode.js`).
- Uzbek dates are written out by the hub: many browsers have no Uzbek month names and printed “M11 14” on the public page.
- `hubctl deploy` takes a backup first and stops if it fails.

## 5.0.0 — 2026-10-03

- **Single-use invites** (setting `signin_mode`, Settings → How people sign in). An invite (`#/invite?k=…`) works once: the person opens it and picks *Sign in with Google*, a password (own server) or *just this device*, and it is used up. Messages, reminders and the bot never carry a key, so a forwarded or leaked message lets nobody in. A newer invite switches the older one off; invites expire after `invite_days` (7). People shows *invite sent* / *invite expired*; *⋯ → New invite & message*. **New hubs start with invites; hubs from before v5 keep personal links until an admin switches** — links people already have keep working until you reset them.
- **Apply page in English, Uzbek and Russian** (`#/apply`). Pick the languages of the public page and the Apply page in Settings → Public page (the first is the default; `?lang=uz` picks one). The form now asks for school, several interests and free time; answers are stored in English with the language used, so the dashboard reads the same. The tagline and the join-form text can be written per language. Adding a language is one block in `docs/js/i18n.js` (CONTRIBUTING.md). ⚠️ The Uzbek and Russian texts need a native speaker's check.
- **Participant signups.** Leads type HQ's count on the Overview (or send `/signups 57` to the bot, or a script pushes it with the feed key). The Signups card shows the goal, the trend and the funding estimate (`funding_per_signup`); the public page can show the count (`public_show_signups`).
- **Group feed.** The organizer group hears about new signup counts, new applications (first name + interest only) and new files — each can be switched off (`feed_signups`, `feed_applications`, `feed_files`).
- **Inbox.** `apps-script/inbox-watcher.gs` runs in your city mailbox's own Google account (the hub never gets permission to read mail) and reports new emails every 5 minutes. Leads see them in *Inbox*, get a Telegram message (`inbox_alerts`), and mark each one handled, ignored, or turn it into a task.
- **Uploads on Files.** Anyone on the team uploads a picture, PDF, Office file, ZIP, MP4/MP3, font or text file (up to about 6 MB) — team-only by default. Files live in a private Drive folder (Google Sheet hubs) or `data/files` (own server) and are only handed to people allowed to see the tile. Uploaders and leads delete them.
- **Feed key** (Settings → Connections): lets outside scripts call `inbox.push` and `signups.push` — nothing else. Renew it to switch every script off.
- **Referral page, part 1.** `apps-script/referrals/Code.gs` — a small separate web app on its own “Referrals” Sheet (`time · name · code`): a visitor opens `?code=…`, types their name, the row is saved and they go on to HQ's signup page with `?ref=<code>`, so HQ counts the referral. Set `SIGNUP_URL` and `EVENT_NAME` at the top for your city. It is not part of the hub backend.
- Setup wizard: invites on/off and the page languages. Demo and showcase updated. `apply` answers `dup: true` for a repeat; `ping` reports the sign-in mode.
- Fixes: the server's allowed-origins list was read as one string; a reminders test failed near midnight in some time zones.

## 4.5.1 — 2026-10-03

- **Last seen = the last time someone opened the hub.** Every visit stamps a new `last_seen` column in People (at most every 5 minutes); People, Team, the person pages, Scorecards (“Silent” = not on the hub for 5+ days) and the weekly report use it. Before, it was the last thing they *did*.
- Privacy and terms pages (`docs/privacy.html`, `docs/terms.html`) — Google asks for them before an OAuth app can be published.

## 4.5.0 — 2026-10-03

- **Showcase + guided tour.** The front page of the shared website is now a tour of what every role gets, with screenshots of the real app, and `?demo=1&tour=1` walks through it live — the real backend in the browser on a made-up team. The demo now lives in `docs/demo/`, so it works on GitHub Pages.
- **Sponsors page.** A logo gallery: drop a picture to add a sponsor (it is shrunk in the browser), set the kind, a public one-liner, a private note, order and visibility. Public sponsors appear as *Supported by* on the public page. *Copy for haven.hackclub.com* exports the `sponsors` block for the city page on HQ's site. Logos are public pictures: a public Drive folder, or `/files/pub/` on your own server.
- **Profile photos.** Everyone can add a photo (made small in the browser); admins can set anyone's. Shown next to names everywhere, never on the public page.
- **A page per person** (`#/team/<key>`): photo, job, contacts, open and finished tasks with proof, hours given, on-time rate and their latest activity; admins edit, reset and remove from there. The Team page is a grid of photo cards with progress for leads.
- **Applications know your team.** An applicant with the same email, Telegram username or name as someone on the team (or someone removed) is flagged — close it as theirs, give them a task, or open their page. A first name alone is a *maybe*.
- **Sign in with Google.** Optional, no Google script on the page. People connect Google in Profile, or match the verified email an admin saved; new people can *Sign up with Google* on the join form. Apps Script checks tokens with Google's `tokeninfo`; the server checks the signature itself (`server/google.mjs`).
- **Password reset links** (own server): *People → ⋯ → Send a password reset link* — by Telegram, email or copy; one use, 24 hours, keeps the username.
- Settings: *Sign in with Google* card with the exact addresses to register. `hubUrl_()` adds `?hub=` to links in admin messages. Neutral defaults (time zone `UTC`, example domains). GitHub Actions runs the tests.
